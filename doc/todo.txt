once the client has recieved all the neccessary javascript files the client app is launched
with app start(). its at this point our server is going to start tracking the client we have this TCP connection 
at a FV (application level). a request is made to the server, its purpose is to deliver the neccessary data to the 
client to initalize the app. After this the specific default module (or specified with params) is loaded and a request is made for 
the view specific module. 

what needs to happen:
1) We currently dont have the event_date on the psql record. Need to adjust the scrape script to collect this and add the field to the db
table
1)b the event_date will likely need to be transformed into a suitable format for the psql db to accept its
2) Next we need to add the query to the server to get the event_date from the db and give it to the client on the initalize request
3) Next this needs to be stores in the menu component as it will determine the default view, this value will be displayed in the UI
and be updatable through the search/list module.

this is our first look at the client, notabley an IP adress
